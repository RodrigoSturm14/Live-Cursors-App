# Description
React app that shares realtime cursor's position throught WebSocket, which enables bidirectional and realtime updates from the server and client. The client side was made with React, using the `react-use-websocket` library, while the server was made with Node.js using the `WebSocket library`. 

The goal was to develop a functional, stateful and bidirectional communication between a React client and a Node.js server using WebSocket.
